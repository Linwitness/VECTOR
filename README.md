This project provides four smoothing algorithms to get the inclination of each voxel on the 2D and 3D sharp boundary: Vertex smoothing algorithm, Allen-Cahn smoothing algorithm, Level-Set smoothing algorithm and Bilinear smoothing algorithm.

All smoothing algorithm can work parallel.

main.py is the place to running these smoothing algorithms.
Input/ includes several input examples.
Output/ includes algorithm results.
